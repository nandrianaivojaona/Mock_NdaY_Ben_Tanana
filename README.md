Below is a comprehensive README.md file for the NdaY’Ben’Tanàna MVP project, designed to provide clear instructions for setting up, running, and understanding the codebase. It includes an overview, setup guide, usage instructions, project structure, and future enhancements, tailored to the tax payment and mayor dashboard features with the updated mock data (5 citizens, one with 3 properties, and 1 mayor).
NdaY’Ben’Tanàna MVP
NdaY’Ben’Tanàna is a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for a digital platform that simplifies land tax payments and municipal governance. The MVP includes a Citizen Portal for taxpayers to view and pay property taxes and a Mayor Dashboard for municipal administrators to monitor land properties and tax collection status. It also features a basic USSD simulation for low-tech users. The project uses mock data to simulate 5 citizens (one with 3 properties, others with 1 each) and 1 mayor, demonstrating its potential for the Orange POESAM 2025 award.

User login for citizens.
View property details (address, tax amount, status).
Pay taxes for unpaid properties.
View payment history (via property status).
Mayor Dashboard:
Admin login for the mayor.
Overview of municipality: total properties (7), taxpayers (5), paid properties, and collection rate (~42.86% initially).
List of all properties with tax status, filterable by paid/unpaid.
USSD Simulation:
Basic API to mimic USSD tax payment for low-tech users.
Supports viewing properties and paying taxes by phone number.
Security:
JWT-based authentication for citizens and mayor.

Tech Stack
Frontend: React.js (with axios, react-router-dom)
Backend: Node.js, Express.js (with jsonwebtoken, cors)
Database: Mock data (JSON, in-memory; extensible to MongoDB/PostgreSQL)
Development: Local setup (can be deployed to Vercel/Heroku)

Prerequisites
Node.js (v14 or higher)
npm (v6 or higher)
Git (optional, for cloning)
A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox)
Postman (optional, for testing USSD API)
Installation
Clone the Repository (or download the code):
bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd ndaybentanana
Set Up the Backend:
bash
cd server
npm install
Set Up the Frontend:
bash
cd ../client
npm install
Usage
Start the Backend:
bash
cd server
node index.js
The server runs on http://localhost:5000.
Start the Frontend:
bash
cd client
npm start
The app opens at http://localhost:3000 in your browser.
Test the Application:
Login:
Citizens: Use credentials like username: citizen1, password: pass123 (valid for citizen1 to citizen5).
Mayor: Use username: mayor, password: admin123.
Citizen Portal:
For citizen1: View 3 properties (e.g., PROP001: unpaid, PROP002: paid, PROP003: unpaid).
For citizen2 to citizen5: View 1 property each.
Pay taxes for unpaid properties.
Mayor Dashboard:
View municipality stats: 7 properties, 5 taxpayers, 3 paid properties, ~42.86% collection rate.
Filter properties by status (all/paid/unpaid).
USSD Simulation (via Postman):
POST to http://localhost:5000/api/ussd:
json
{ "phone": "1234567891", "input": "1" }
Response: Lists properties for citizen1 (e.g., PROP001: 50000 XAF (unpaid), ...).
json
{ "phone": "1234567891", "input": "pay PROP001" }
Response: Payment successful via USSD.
Use phone numbers 1234567891 to 1234567895 for citizen1 to citizen5.
Mock Data
The mock data simulates a municipality with:
Users: 6 total
5 citizens (citizen1 to citizen5, password: pass123).
1 mayor (mayor, password: admin123).
Taxpayers: 5 total
TAX001 (John Doe): 3 properties (PROP001: unpaid, PROP002: paid, PROP003: unpaid).
TAX002 to TAX005 (Jane Smith, Alice Brown, Bob Johnson, Emma Wilson): 1 property each (mixed paid/unpaid).
Total properties: 7.
Transactions: 3 payments (for PROP002, PROP004, PROP007).
Data Location: server/data/mockData.js.

Notes
The README.md is designed to be clear for developers, evaluators (e.g., POESAM jury), or collaborators.
It assumes the project is stored in a repository (e.g., GitHub); adjust the git clone URL as needed.
The mock data section reflects the updated requirement (5 citizens, one with 3 properties, 1 mayor).
The file can be placed at the root of the project directory (ndaybentanana/README.md).
To use this, save the content as README.md in your project root and ensure all dependencies are installed as described. Let me know if you need help with additional documentation or specific sections!
